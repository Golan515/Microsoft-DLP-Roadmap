# DLP roadmap

## 1. Assessment and Planning
### a. Identify Data
##### Data Discovery: Use tools to scan and identify where sensitive data resides across the organization (e.g., databases, file servers, endpoints, cloud storage).
##### Data Classification: Categorize data based on sensitivity and importance (e.g., public, internal, confidential, highly confidential).
### b. Risk Assessment
##### Threat Analysis: Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities that could lead to data loss or leakage.
##### Impact Assessment: Determine the potential impact of data loss on the organization, including regulatory, financial, and reputational consequences.
### c. Define Objectives
##### Compliance Requirements: Ensure DLP strategy meets industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA).
##### Business Goals: Align DLP objectives with business goals (e.g., protecting intellectual property, ensuring customer trust).
## 2. Strategy Development
### a. Policy Creation
##### Data Handling Policies: Develop policies for data access, sharing, storage, and disposal.
##### Incident Response Plan: Create a plan for responding to data loss incidents, including roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols.
### b. Solution Selection
##### DLP Tools and Technologies: Evaluate and select DLP solutions that fit the organization’s needs (e.g., endpoint DLP, network DLP, cloud DLP).
##### Integration: Ensure DLP solutions integrate with existing security infrastructure (e.g., SIEM, IAM).
## 3. Implementation
### a. Pilot Program
##### Test Environment: Implement DLP solutions in a controlled environment to test effectiveness and identify issues.
##### Feedback Loop: Gather feedback from stakeholders and adjust policies and configurations as needed.
### b. Full Deployment
##### Phased Rollout: Deploy DLP solutions in phases, starting with high-risk areas.
##### Training: Provide training for employees on data handling policies and the use of DLP tools.
## 4. Monitoring and Maintenance
### a. Continuous Monitoring
##### Activity Monitoring: Use DLP tools to continuously monitor data usage and movement.
##### Alerts and Reporting: Set up alerts for potential data loss incidents and generate regular reports for review.
### b. Regular Audits
##### Policy Compliance: Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with data handling policies.
##### Effectiveness Assessment: Review the effectiveness of DLP measures and make improvements as needed.
## 5. Incident Response
### a. Detection and Analysis
##### Incident Detection: Use DLP tools to detect potential data loss incidents.
##### Root Cause Analysis: Analyze incidents to determine the root cause and prevent recurrence.
### b. Response and Remediation
##### Incident Handling: Follow the incident response plan to address data loss incidents.
##### Remediation Actions: Take corrective actions to mitigate the impact of the incident and prevent future occurrences.
## 6. Review and Improvement
### a. Post-Incident Review
##### Lessons Learned: Conduct post-incident reviews to identify lessons learned and improve processes.
##### Policy Updates: Update data handling policies and the incident response plan based on review findings.
### b. Continuous Improvement
##### Feedback Mechanism: Establish a mechanism for ongoing feedback and improvement of DLP strategies.
##### Emerging Threats: Stay informed about emerging threats and update DLP measures accordingly.
### Tools and Technologies
##### DLP Solutions: Symantec DLP, Forcepoint DLP, McAfee Total Protection for DLP, Digital Guardian, Microsoft Information Protection.
##### Data Discovery Tools: Varonis, Spirion, Digital Guardian.
##### Monitoring Tools: Splunk, ELK Stack, SolarWinds.
##### Training Platforms: KnowBe4, SANS Institute.
### Key Considerations
##### User Awareness: Regular training and awareness programs for employees.
##### Scalability: Ensure DLP solutions can scale with the organization’s growth.
##### Privacy Concerns: Balance DLP measures with employee privacy and data protection regulations.
##### Stakeholder Involvement: Engage stakeholders from different departments for a comprehensive approach.





DLP Plan

# DLP lifecycle
A DLP implementation typically follows these major phases.

##### Plan for DLP
##### Prepare for DLP
##### Deploy your policies in production

## Plan for DLP
### Technology planning for DLP
#### Keep in mind that DLP as a technology can monitor and protect your data at rest, data in use and data in motion. 
#### There are planning implications for the different locations, the type of data you want to monitor and protect, and the actions to be taken when a policy match occurs.

###  Business processes planning for DLP
#### DLP policies can block users from performing prohibited activities, like inappropriate sharing of sensitive information via email.
#### As you plan your DLP policies, you must identify the business processes that touch your sensitive items. 
#### The business process owners can help you identify appropriate user behaviors that should be allowed and inappropriate user behaviors that should be protected against. 
#### You should plan your policies and deploy them in simulation mode, and evaluate their impact, before running them in more restrictive modes.

### Organizational culture planning for DLP
#### A successful DLP implementation is as much dependent on getting your users trained and acclimated to data loss prevention practices as it is on well planned and tuned policies. 
#### Since your users are heavily involved, be sure to plan for training for them too. 
#### You can strategically use policy tips to raise awareness with your users before changing the policy status from simulation mode to more restrictive modes.

## Prepare for DLP
You can apply DLP policies to data at rest, data in use, and data in motion in locations such as:
### Exchange Online email - distribution groups
### SharePoint sites - sites
### OneDrive accounts - accounts or distribution groups
### Teams chat and channel messages - account or distribution group
### Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (Instances) 
### Windows 10, Windows 11, and macOS (three latest released versions) devices - user or group
### On-premises repositories - repository file path
### Power BI sites - workspaces
